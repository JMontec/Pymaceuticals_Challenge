## Pymaceuticals
The Pymaceuticals code merges two sets of data into a single dataframe. Then it counts the total number of mice in the dataframe.
Then Pymaceuticals locates duplicate mice data and shows it in a dataframe. A new clean dataframe is created dropping the duplicate data.
Pymaceuticals calculates the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume by each drug regimen into a dataframe.
Another data frame is creating calculating the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM using the groupby and aggregate function into a dataframe.
Next Pymaceuticals create a bar graph for each drug and # of observed mouse timepoints. A pie chart is also created to calculate the gender of mice in the study.
Pymaceuticals then calculates the quartiles and outliers for each drug regimen in the study. From this information a box plot is created showing tumor volume in relation to each drug. A line graph is made for the drug Capomulin showing tumor volume and timepoint. Lastly Pymaceuticals creates a scatter plot from calculating the average weight of the mice and the tumor volume. Lastly a linear regression line is formed on the scatter plot created before.
